<h1>NumPy Analysis</h1>

<p>Analysis of NumPy library in transpose, matricial product and matricial 
sum operations, using a 100x100 matrix. Number of operations is equal to 100 mi,
divided in 100 blocks of 1000000 operations.</p>

<p>The time values for each operations blocks is stored in a .cvs file("times").
To run the code uncomment the operation in MAIN CODE. Run one operation at time.
You can easily edit or add a operation to analyze the running time.</p>
